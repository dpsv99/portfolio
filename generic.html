							<h2>Education</h2>
							<p>
								Born in Karaikal, Pondicherry, and raised in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, I attended GKD for my schooling. For my undergraduate studies, I enrolled at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, renowned in the city. Later, I pursued an integrated five-year MSc program in software systems, a pivotal point in my academic journey. During my time at CIT, I undertook two significant internships.
								It was during this internship that I interacted with inspiring individuals who encouraged me to consider pursuing a master's degree in the United States, emphasizing the value it could bring to my career.
								Upon completing my undergraduate studies, I applied and gained admission to Texas State for my master's in Computer Science. Although I initially grappled with deciding between roles as a SQL developer, Software Engineer, or UI/UX developer due to my diverse experiences, I successfully graduated from Texas State and am now eager to embark on a fulfilling career in the Information Technology field.

							<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
						<p>
							During my academic journey, I had the privilege of contributing to various impactful projects and gaining hands-on experience in the field of Information Technology. As a Graduate Instructional Assistant at Texas State University, I played a crucial role in mentoring fellow students in both C++ and Python programming languages. Additionally, I took the initiative to design comprehensive course materials for engaging lab demonstrations. Through these efforts, I was able to significantly enhance student performance, achieving an impressive 80% average passing rate. Prior to this, during my internship at Gyaanbee in Coimbatore, India, I honed my skills in web development by constructing modules on their existing platform, utilizing technologies such as React, Node.js, and SQL databases. I also played a pivotal role in the transition to a revamped website design, providing essential bug fixes and code enhancements. Furthermore, my tenure at Rheinbrucke IT Consulting Ltd in Chennai, India, was instrumental in refining my proficiency in application development. Here, I contributed to the creation of screens catering to prominent blending industries, leveraging .NET (C#). I also provided valuable solutions and guidance on SSRS reports, and introduced a standardized model for generating organizational charts using D3.js. These diverse experiences have equipped me with a robust skill set and a keen understanding of software development and its practical applications. I am eager to leverage these experiences in my future endeavors within the IT industry.
